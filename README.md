# epidemic-modeling

This github repository is made to share my team's work of the 2nd year project included in the UCL Mathematics with Economics BSc curriculum.

Our project was to conduct an academic survey in epidemic modeling and present our summary for an academic committe and  fellow students. During the presentation we used this ipython notebook to visualize an epidemic on a scale-free network initialized by the Albert-Barabasi algorithm.

The slides used during our presentation can be found in the repository as well.
